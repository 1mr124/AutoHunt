# AutoHunt

AutoHunt is an automation framework for bug hunting and penetration testing. It streamlines the process of identifying vulnerabilities, making security testing faster and more efficient. The project is designed with a modular structure and clean coding principles to ensure extensibility and maintainability.

## Features
- **Automated Scanning**: Quickly identify potential vulnerabilities in a target system.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Add or adjust modules to suit specific testing needs.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports integration with multiple clients and databases.
- **Future Support**: Plans to integrate advanced analysis tools and reporting systems.

## Project Structure
```
/AutoHunt
├── backend (Flask-based API)
├── client (React front-end)
├── database (Planned: Store scan results for search and retrieval)
├── modules (Pluggable scanning and analysis components)
└── docs (Documentation and guides)
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Frontend Setup
- [ ] Initialize a React front-end for a user-friendly interface.
- [ ] Design an intuitive UI for initiating and managing scans.

### 2. Scan Management
- [ ] Add functionality to start scans directly from the UI.
- [ ] Implement progress tracking and status updates during scans.

### 3. Database Integration
- [ ] Configure a database for storing scan results.
- [ ] Develop search and filtering capabilities for results.

### 4. Vulnerability Analysis
- [ ] Add a module to search for service version vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Provide actionable recommendations based on discovered vulnerabilities.

### 5. Reporting and Export
- [ ] Generate detailed reports for completed scans.
- [ ] Support exporting results in common formats (e.g., PDF, CSV).
